requirements file for pip
build script
setup script
language.py - module for handling language structure
logic structures
recursive jobs
logging
ability to setup repetitive jobs
hooks and triggers - REST client?

Use Cases:
Execute code on specific machines right now
 - Define the job contents in an environment.yaml file
 - execute makeitso [environment] [task]
Execute code later


Execution model
 - makeitso only performs actions on its local machine
 - connect to target machine (mechanism of choice), run makeitso with execution string

Language Changes:


Disseminating Configuration:

Security:
 - Actions are determined by yaml files in a directory on actionable machines
 - Actionable machines know about
    - The version of their yaml: checksum
    - The host keys of machines allowed to provide new yaml
 - Commands arrive with a yaml version, and a hostkey
 - If the version matches, the code will be executed
 - Push commands can distribute new yaml
 - Push commands come with the machines hostkey
 - If the comparison succeeds, the new yaml is installed

 - This means that any machine with makeitso and the same version of the taml can instigate deployment commands

Changes:
 - Only execute code if hostname is equal to target machine

Deployment:
 - makeitso user must exist
 - sudo must alow makeitso-priv to run
 - ssh keys must allow makeitso to connect to
 - yaml files must be in place

Config file synchronization:
 - 

The yaml files have a checksum as a total
Remote calls to makeitso come from a checksum
yaml files must be propogated somehow

Maybes:
 - Should we use an existing protocol such as gossip?
